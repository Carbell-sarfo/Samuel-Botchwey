The world we live in today makes it imperative that we just not think but do so with reasoning. Why? so much as it is, Reasoning happens to form the basis of much of our thinking. Matthew Allen, makes it known in his book as to how one can make probable arguments through effective reasoning.

# Synopsis

This book focusses on the analytical structural format, primarily as a means of learning about reasoning, but also as a tool for planning the construction and presentation of arguments and explanation. This book proposes a framework that , when combined with the concept of analytical inquiries, has a means of reflecting the mental processes that smart thinkers must go through.

It was also stated that smart thinking is more than a method of skill. It is a mentality. The book provides a series of exercises, inquiring further as to why practice is necessary. This tends to make one aware of what one should be doing and that if willing, once can reflect on and learn about the reasoning process.

This is how one develops the proper mindset for becoming a smart thinker, competent in reasoning and capable of achieving one's objectives through arguments and explanations.

# Thoughts

I, on a personal level, that is think this is a fantastic book. I happen to be a huge believer in logic. Why? I have been in a number of instances where both my own and my opponent's  arguments are of course, illogical. I, however grew to understand to the importance of being logical in any argument or claim. 

This book helps clear the fog on this path I was on. I very much appreciate the exercises that were offered together with the discussions to help us bring out the practical side of our minds. However, I would have loved if the concept extended beyond making reasonable arguments and the sorts of 'schooling setting' to being able to apply them to daily situations.

Regardless, if one truly immerses oneself in what is being stated, it is easy to see how this is applicable. Above all, this book turned out again to be a fantastic read, and I am glad I stumbled on it because it has contributed value to me.

# Recommendation

In a non-biased approach, I recommend that everyone reading this blog post should consider getting a copy of this book. This book should be on your list on must-reads. if you want to improve your ability to make plausible and rational arguments and claims. 

This would be beneficial to you in the same way that it has been beneficial to me.

***Happy Reading !!!***
