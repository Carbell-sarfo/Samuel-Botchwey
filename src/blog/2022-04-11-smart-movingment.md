Willpower is what separates us from the animals. It's the capacity to restrain our impulses, resist temptation, do what's right and good for us in the long run, not what we want to do right now. It's central, in fact, to civilization.

Roy Baumeister

Ever wondered how siblings, parents, friends, a mentor or someone we admire and respect could be so self-disciplined? Trust me, I'm willing to bet they have, if not all, most of the traits explicitly stated in this book as written by Martin Meadows. A person said to have dedicated his life to personal growth.

# Synopsis

This book aimed at giving readers a complete proof yearly plan on how to avoid being a weak-willed person and be self-disciplined right from the start. This yearly plan has been divided into weekly and then daily teachings, with the intention of having a daily impact on one's life. This can be achieved when one reads with open mindedness and ponders on what is being said to milkout the true meaning.

Through this book, readers are made well-versed with well thought quotes on a daily basis, some from well known sources and others not really known. The book referenced them as life-altering thoughts on self control, mental resilience and success. Evidently, does this book takes us on a journey, with daily nuggets which serves as a stepping stone in becoming a more self-disciplined person.

# Thoughts

I was quite overwhelmed actually having to absorb all this nuggets. The book was constructed in an easy to read format, with short but insightful lesson for each day. Throughout the book, the read gave readers the tendency to be able to engage their ideas and thought process. I appreciate the book references since they introduce readers to a variety of books that expressly discuss the subject matter.

 I however believe it could have been done much better. Despite being an excellent read, the book sounded repetitious at points. It had an unprofessional feel to it because it kept repeating the same idea. Aside from that, the book is an excellent one in general because it provides a foundation for people to be inspired to attain their goals on a daily basis.

# Recommendation

This book is addressed to everyone. We may have the correct systems, methods and goals as individuals, but sometimes all we need is a push to be self-disciplined in taking action and completing tasks. To all who wish to be better persons( discipline wise), take time to to have a read.

***Happy Reading !!!***
