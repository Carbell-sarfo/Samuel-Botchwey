It is going to be hard to go back to normal especially now that we are constantly informed that we cannot go back to normal.

Lionel Shriver, Spiked.

The world we live in today. Least did anyone expect a global pandemic, causing the deaths of many and transcended to a global economic collapse. History tells us this hasn't been the first. How then were the past situations handled? What would be the post effect of the pandemic? What influence would that have on us now and in the future and how do we recover from this from an economic perspective. All this does this read, The New Great Depression enlighten us about.

# Synopsis

The current crises isn't the same as the that of 2008 or 1929. The New Great Depression, which resulted from the Covid pandemic, is worst the worst economic downturn in history. The majority of those who have been fired will continue to be redundant. Bankruptcies will be common, and banks will succumb to the weight of bad debts. 

This read brought to understanding, any chance of recovery will be shattered be deflation, inflation, debt and demography, with social disorder following closely behind market chats. 

Despite the fact, not all hope is lost for savvy investors. This read peels back the curtain on the underlying risks to our financial system and what wise investors may do to survive-and perhaps flourish-during unprecedented upheaval in the new great depression.

# Thoughts

James Rickards, a New York Times bestselling author throws a clarifying light on the events taking place using historical case studies, monetary theory and behind the scenes access to the halls of power to help investors grasp what's actually going on and what they can do about it.

 Despite the fact the read seemed to be overly directed to investors, it was structured in an easy to read manner by which any average person could read and grasp the content of what is being said. What I prefer to see in books is facts ( well certain kind of), and I must say Rickards pulled it off extremely well. 

As it is said, hitting the nail right on the head. However viable his advises were on what investments to make, I firmly believe it was a brief overview of what it actually entails in pulling off such investments. To follow blindly what is said might put you in a situation adversely opposite that what is to be the case. Aside all, I love the read, and I hope you will as well.

# Recommendation

A must read to open minded persons who gives a thought to investing and will like to know how one can direct resources to make probable investments and protect them during the greatest economic downturn in history. This happens to be his latest read and I recommend you read his precious books before this read.
