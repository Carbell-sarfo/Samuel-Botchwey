                <p>Hey there! I'm Samuel, a 21-year-old soon to be a graduate in the Bachelor of Business Administration. I take personal interest in the world of Business, to be specific that of investing. I as well claim to have a self-certified passion in music (I mean who doesn't). 
                    <br>
                However, my interest mostly lies in classical music which justifies how much I love the voilin.
                <br>
                I have a broad base books collection which I would be showing and give my objective view of the books as well as some recommendations. I have a deep fondness with my collection of books as they tend to define who I am. I'm a chess player as well. Due to the fact it teaches open mindedness and strategy for the least.
                <br>
                I aspire to become a macro economist. I am currently embarking on a course in Business Intelligence Anaysis which would serve as a stepping stone moving forward in the career game.
